Robbers of the world, having by universal plunder exhausted the land, their drive is greed. If the enemy be rich, they are rapacious; if poor, they lust for domination. Neither rule of the East nor West can satisfy them. Alone among men, they crave with equal eagerness poverty and riches. To plunder, slaughter, seize with false pretenses, they give the lying name \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcempire.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And where nothing remains but a desert, they call that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeace.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tacitus, The Agricola and the Germania (analyses here , here ). Tacitus wrote ~ 100 AD, a century into empire. Emperors proclaimed to the public that their government still upheld the highest ideals of their Republic, claiming expanding empire was only and always in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-defense.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153One Love! Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get together and feel all right. Hear the children cryin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hear the children cryin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (One Heart! )\u00e2\u20ac\u009d ~ Bob Marley, One Love \nlanguage warning: Socrates and I speak in the same direct language that caused his execution for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corrupting the young.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \nSocrates: Carl! \nCarl: Soc! (bro hug) \nS: How may I be of service? (genuine smile) \nC: I just want to talk with an honest person, bro. We last talked 6 months ago . I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I have anything new to say, but I want to talk with someone who can hear. \nS: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try. What about? \nC: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re finishing a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153election\u00e2\u20ac\u009d season that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jumped the shark\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (and here ) with the Left-wing candidate a proven criminal, and Right-wing candidate a depraved Roman Emperor wanna-be . These are Left and Right arms of one illegal rogue state US empire , of course. \nS: Of course. \nC: So I keep feeling that we have to be near an endgame, Soc. We have to be, given the open floodgates of evidence about s much criminal activity by the .01% centered in war , looting , and lying . \nI mean, really, how much longer can this go on?! \nS: (smiling) Are you asking me, or just pausing for dramatic effect? \nC: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m asking if you have any answers. \nS: (shrugs) I went through a 27-year civil war after almost 50 years of Athenian \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u009d concentrating an empire under their dominion. As we discussed in some detail , Athen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153love of freedom\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and spin that foreign barbarians \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hate us for our freedoms\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was total inversion of the facts because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freedom\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was only meant for us, and not anyone else. Everyone else had to pay tribute or face military invasion. \nThis hypocrisy in my time produced civil war. Those of us voicing the facts were insufficient to prevent it, or stop it once started. (Pauses to look intensely into my eyes) \nSo you tell me: how much longer could your struggle go on? \nC: Fuck. \nI really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a civil war. \nS: Fuck, indeed. If it comes, maybe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be lucky. Maybe it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last 27 years. \nC: Fuck. \nS: But I do have a brighter perspective. I mean, how many of the non-sheeple would care to talk with me if all I ever did is leave them discouraged? (chuckles) Who would converse with Socrates if those who did were asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, how did your conversation with Socrates go?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the responses were all disheartened, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFuck!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (laughs) \nC: Alright, go. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the higher light? \nS: You already know it. You tell me. \nC: Ok, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right. Maybe my being on Earth is all about growth, truth, and service, and I have to exercise real-world Faith to the One Life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my job as a guest on this planet to harmonize in service to the Goddess \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan for Earth. Those of us who are relative beacons of light are isolated by design, obviously, by the facts of our relative leadership and lack of response from the public. \n(smile) At least I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been voted by my peers for execution, as you were, Soc, for standing for truth. \nS: Not yet, anyway. If you had taken other pathways, you would have been assassinated by your oligarchs, such as Martin King , President Kennedy , and others . \nC: (sigh) I guess I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have anything new to discuss. I just want to win this game. End the empire. Have truth and love. \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long war, bro. \nS: Indeed it has. Longer than you know. \nC: So much bullshit . \nS: Only bullshit. Any truth has been co-opted, controlled, and used to mask the empire. The only reason I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m allowed onto your history pages is pretense that humanity lives on a planet operated from ideals of virtue. \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same with religious ideals of love. \nC: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to win. \nS: So was I. \nC: (sigh) Alright. So another day in the empire. Ok. Fine. Real-world exercise of Faith. The Goddess has more evolution to oversee with love and wisdom before we see a breakthrough. I can embrace that. \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really stupid to argue with reality. \nReally stupid. \nS: (smiling) Apparently, yes. \nWe have to work with what we have, assuredly. There is no other option. \nC: We discussed in our previous conversations linked for readers below that the US today compares to your empire in Athens, and the case that perhaps, just maybe, the US is on the verge of breakthrough for Truth and Love. \nS: Perhaps my history can allow perspective on your world of the present, and encourage Americans today to best use their voice and virtue for a brighter path than the civil war we endured. \nCertainly for all interested, this consideration is worthy of investing time and attention. History is literally all we know, and what drives our understanding of the present. History is what informs our direction for building the future. \nAmerica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history is at war between an awakening We the People and a deeply evil .01% committed to undisclosed vicious empire. \nYour history could devolve into civil war. (chuckles) As would-be Emperor Trump might say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sad.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \nC: (shaking my head, slight smile). Ok, I gotta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 go to work. Another day in the empire. My vote still stands to planetary management for full fucking truth in a breakthrough. I like a potential trend with revealing e-mails, but want a breakthrough that causes arrests of our .01% leaders in elegant endgame. \nS: Yes, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to fly, breath underwater swimming like a dolphin, and have daily dinner parties with wine, music and women! \nC: (mock agreement) Me, too! \nOk, our wants aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t our best guides, necessarily. \nI do have to go to work. Back to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153earning a living.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \nS: Make the most of it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your given area of self-expression. \nC: I promise. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll lead by example of my best good-faith expression and experience of virtue. \nAnother day. \nS: Perhaps just another day. Perhaps you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming. \nC: Human limitations. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll work with what I see. \nS: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all I concluded was possible. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all I got for wisdom. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t teach anything other than look for yourself what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right there in front of you to see. Listen to your small voice within for your best call of virtue. \nStep-by-step, my brother. In all empathy, live your Faith that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re loved and guided more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to imagine. \n(bro hug) \nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do our best. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interview\u00e2\u20ac\u009d series:\"\n",
