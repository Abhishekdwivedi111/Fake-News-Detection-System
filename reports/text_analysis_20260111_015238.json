    "content": "\"The last Texas Republican to occupy the Oval Office, George W. Bush, took 49 percent of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hispanic vote in his 2004 presidential re-election, setting a relatively high bar for the handful of Texas-born or -raised Republicans who might be hoping to follow in his footsteps in 2016.\n\nRepublican presidential aspirants with ties to the Lone Star State\u00c2\u00a0must figure out how to hold the GOP base and attract conservative Hispanics if they want to be successful in Texas, political observers say.\n\nSo how do the party's four most prominent Texas affiliated might-be candidates \u00e2\u20ac\u201d former Gov.\u00c2\u00a0Rick Perry; Jeb Bush, the son and brother of two former presidents from the state; Texas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 junior U.S. senator,\u00c2\u00a0Ted Cruz; and\u00c2\u00a0U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stack up in the early going?\n\nFor Republicans to avoid a repeat of 2012, when presidential nominee Mitt Romney took only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide, they need to nominate a conservative candidate who can go into Hispanic communities and truly connect with voters, said Hector De Leon, co-chairman of the\u00c2\u00a0Associated Republicans of Texas, which reaches out to Hispanic voters.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about paying attention,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d De Leon said.\n\nHispanics made up\u00c2\u00a010 percent\u00c2\u00a0of the national\u00c2\u00a0electorate in the 2012 presidential election. But in Texas, they make up\u00c2\u00a0almost one-third\u00c2\u00a0of eligible voters. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty room for improvement when it comes to voter turnout. Only 39 percent of Texas Hispanics eligible to vote cast ballots in 2012.\n\nPolitical observers say candidates would be right to take a page out of George W. Bush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playbook on Hispanic outreach. He\u00c2\u00a0solidified his\u00c2\u00a0winning record\u00c2\u00a0with Hispanics with help from\u00c2\u00a0Latino-media guru\u00c2\u00a0Lionel Sosa,\u00c2\u00a0who told The Texas Tribune he has been in talks with Jeb Bush about his possible presidential bid.\n\nSosa helped George W. Bush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign craft several television ads that painted him as the candidate who understood Hispanic culture.\u00c2\u00a0The candidate who can mobilize on-the-fence Hispanic voters who usually do not turn out to vote could win the state.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do think the primaries will include a concerted effort by some candidates to speak to that constituency,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Sylvia Manzano, a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization Latino Decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Texas, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 million people. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a number that cannot be ignored.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThough it's still early in the game, many political observers say Jeb Bush is best positioned at the moment. He grew up in Midland, spent much of his childhood in Houston and is considered\u00c2\u00a0friendly\u00c2\u00a0to the Hispanic community, both personally and politically.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jeb Bush is not going to come in and play mariachi politics,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Manzano said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He knows better than that.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBut this far out, all is speculation. As the candidates tiptoe toward the starting gate, here's how several political experts handicap the field.\n\nAlready\u00c2\u00a0holding a political advantage\u00c2\u00a0because he is fluent in Spanish, the former Florida governor has experience winning over Hispanics in a state where they make up a large part of the population. During his\u00c2\u00a01998 re-election campaign, Bush won an impressive 61 percent of Florida's Hispanic electorate. It's worth noting, though, that Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly Cuban Hispanic population differs from Texas, where a majority of Hispanics have roots in Mexico.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nFor Bush, reaching out to Texas Hispanics would be an extended family affair. Aside from benefiting from the\u00c2\u00a0groundwork\u00c2\u00a0his family has done in the state, expect to see Bush campaigning with his Mexican-born wife, Columba, and his son, Texas Land CommissionerGeorge P. Bush, at his side. George P.\u00c2\u00a0is also fluent in Spanish and helped found Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a political group that recruits and supports Hispanic Republicans running for public office.\n\nBush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record on issues that resonate with Texas Hispanics, particularly immigration reform, could prove attractive to this voting group. He has urged Congress to pass immigration reform and has highlighted it as a\u00c2\u00a0key issue\u00c2\u00a0in helping Republicans win Hispanics. He also gained national attention last year when he said many of those entering the country illegally do so out of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of love\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for their families.\n\nAs the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest-serving governor, Perry has long courted Texas Hispanics. He has steadily improved his standing since winning only 13 percent of the Hispanic vote when he defeated Hispanic businessman Tony Sanchez of Laredo in 2002. By the time he was re-elected in 2010, Perry pulled in 38 percent of Hispanic voters.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nPerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to broaden his appeal were buoyed by the passage of the Texas Dream Act during his 14-year tenure. Though the future of the law granting in-state tuition to some undocumented immigrants is\u00c2\u00a0unclear, Perry has stood by it both on the national stage and at home. During a 2011 presidential debate, Perry famously told opponents who challenged his support of the law that they had no heart. More recently, as the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new GOP leadership works to overturn the law, Perry has been vocal about his\u00c2\u00a0continued support\u00c2\u00a0for it.\n\nBecause he\u00c2\u00a0presided over\u00c2\u00a0the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic boom in the last decade, Perry has a unique opportunity to appeal to Hispanics on economic issues. If Perry can convince Hispanic voters that they benefited from the so-called Texas Miracle, he may be able to sway some on-the-fence voters his way.\n\nThough he is the only Hispanic in the group \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the first Hispanic senator from Texas \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Cruz has largely avoided making heritage part of his political persona beyond recounting his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journey to the United States from Cuban as an exile in 1957. Still, he has done well with Texas Hispanics. In 2012, he outperformed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, taking 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to a Latino Decisions\u00c2\u00a0poll.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nCruz arguably faces the toughest challenge courting Texas Hispanics given his divisive tone on immigration and health care. He has been vocal in his opposition to President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive order on immigration, which will grant millions of undocumented immigrants work permits and reprieve from deportation proceedings. The order is widely popular among Hispanics. On health care, Cruz has been one of the biggest foes of the federal Affordable Care Act. Texas Hispanics \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who make up a large portion of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uninsured population \u00e2\u20ac\u201doverwhelmingly support\u00c2\u00a0the health law.\n\nThough Paul was elected to the Senate from Kentucky, where Hispanics make up only 3 percent of the population, he grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas, where Hispanics are one-fifth of the population. Paul has spent the last few months preaching a\u00c2\u00a0message of Hispanic inclusion\u00c2\u00a0within the Republican ranks.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nPaul is someone to watch in the upcoming election when it comes to appealing to Texas Hispanics because of his views on growing the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number of Hispanic supporters. Because he is largely unknown among Texas Hispanics, Paul also has some room to improve his standing. A November 2014 poll by Latino Decisions found that almost a third of Texas Latino voters have no opinion of Paul.\"\n",
