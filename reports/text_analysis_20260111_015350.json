Not true.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0Trump said Clinton made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a terrible mistake on Libya\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0Trump cherry-picked Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words when he claimed Clinton said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.\n\nThe forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. Today\u00c2\u00a0show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.\n\nTrump said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was totally against the war in Iraq,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support either candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong assertions.\n\nOur review of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d about six months before the war started.\n\nStern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, I guess so.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.\n\nAs for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBut just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war \u00e2\u20ac\u0153after it happened.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe Clinton campaign cited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.\n\nCavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and he predicted the market will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go up like a rocket\u00e2\u20ac\u009d after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer an opinion.\n\nAs early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews\u00c2\u00a0about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Scarborough, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nClinton invited her audience to read Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump and the Iraq War.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump said President Obama set a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain date\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.\n\nNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to give details because he wants to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unpredictable.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trump responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.\n\nAs we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a terrible decision.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.\n\nOnce Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a deal to be made with Maliki.\n\nSo, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain date\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.\n\nTrump said that Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high officials\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of a host country did not appear to greet the president.\n\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.\n\nTrump referred to the fact that Cuba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.\n\nWhether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.\n\nIn 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nThese and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fact Checker,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visits were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without precedent.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Kessler said of Trump, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153once again he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong, wrong, wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nKessler also noted that during Richard Nixon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.\n\nClinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.\n\nBut Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not do that,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trump said, referring to Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he supports privatization.\n\nTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign published \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Goals Of Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Veterans Plan\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on its website last October. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call for the VA to be completely privatized.\n\nOne of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the plan states.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 healthcare dollars,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the plan says.\n\nTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.\n\nTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.\n\nTrump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in July.\n\nPoint 10 of the plan says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.\n\nTo be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.\n\nTrump criticized Clinton for making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a terrible mistake on Libya\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\n\nTrump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prepared on Day One,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d if elected president, to tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complex national security issues.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.\n\nDuring the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never discussed that subject\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on a humanitarian basis\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:\n\nEven though Trump now says Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for intervention in Libya was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible mistake,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s removal.\n\nTrump twisted Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words when he claimed Clinton said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including the issue of wait times for doctors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and what she would do to address them.\n\nTrump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the big problems\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the VA has problems.\n\nLauer interrupted, noting that Clinton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump insisted his version was accurate, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m telling you \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Maddow said.\n\nMaddow asked if Clinton had any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new ideas for trying to fix\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the VA. Here was Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.\n\nClinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153want it to fail\u00e2\u20ac\u009d so they can privatize it.\n\nClinton added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIndeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentally reform veterans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The campaign says Clinton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The site specifically mentions Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dissatisfaction that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and promises she will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump cherry-picked the part of Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response that said problems in the VA have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to make the blanket claim that Clinton is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.\"\n",
