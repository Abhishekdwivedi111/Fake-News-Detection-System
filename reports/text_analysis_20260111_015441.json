But the deeper problem is undeniably real: Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities \u00e2\u20ac\u201d corporate and governmental \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that are gaining control over news, freedom of expression\u00c2\u00a0and much of our digital lives. The irony is that the conservatives and business-backed Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control.\n\nAlmost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word. Along with Google, it dominates online advertising; Facebook especially does so on mobile devices, which are the way many people connect to the Internet. If you offer news and information online, you have almost no choice but to play on Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s field\u00c2\u00a0because so much of your audience is there. (In some parts of the world, Facebook essentially is the Internet, because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access\u00c2\u00a0and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and,\u00c2\u00a0or governments.)\n\nFacebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition: Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus. This is smart \u00e2\u20ac\u201d no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a red flag. As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago, he wants Facebook to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like electricity.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Well, electricity is a utility. And we regulate utilities.\n\nMonopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members. They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their nature. Which is why capitalism, plainly the best system when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working right, needs rules to promote competition.\n\nYet Republicans, in general, think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition. They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive, at best \u00e2\u20ac\u201d except, of course, when a powerful constituent (a corporation, usually) is in danger from predatory behavior.\n\nThat attitude accounts for the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access. Republicans, in general, are fine with the idea that one or two companies (say the leading cable provider and another telecom) should control access in most communities, and utterly opposed to a remedy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d what we call network neutrality \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to ensure that people at the edges of networks, not dominant Internet service providers, should decide what information they want and at what priority.\n\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the government to tell Facebook what it can publish\u00c2\u00a0and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look forward to much more than posturing from Congress. But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly\u00c2\u00a0and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online. I want government to use antitrust and other pro-competition laws to ensure that Facebook doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abuse its dominance in a business sense. I want government(s) to promote open technology and communications, and fierce competition at every level. Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing achievement.\u00c2\u00a0But we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service, or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook users.\n\nWe all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression. Once you are in its enclosed online space, it is the corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms of service, not the First Amendment, that determines what you can say. If it decides to downplay speech it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like, Facebook has the right to do so.\n\nSo I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad that conservatives are concerned, even if the allegations prove overblown. (Facebook has modified its outright denial to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking into it\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stance; stay tuned.)\u00c2\u00a0I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in uncharted information-freedom territory under the new control freaks of Silicon Valley.\n\nDan Gillmor teaches digital media literacy at Arizona State University.
