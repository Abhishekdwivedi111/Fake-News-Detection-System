Hospitals that had been operating at near capacity are now seeing fewer emergency admissions related to respiratory complications.\n\nDoctors emphasized the importance of continued vaccination and hygiene practices, especially for elderly individuals and those with chronic illnesses. The Health Department stated that awareness campaigns conducted in schools and workplaces played a significant role in slowing transmission rates.\n\nAuthorities are also monitoring new virus variants but said there is currently no evidence suggesting increased severity. Citizens were advised to seek medical attention if symptoms persist and to avoid self-medication without professional guidance.",
