According to the company, the drink contains a blend of natural ingredients traditionally used in alternative medicine systems.\n\nThe company claims that regular consumption can help improve mental clarity, reduce stress, and enhance learning ability. Several social media influencers have shared positive experiences after using the product for two weeks.\n\nHowever, medical experts have stated that there is currently limited scientific evidence to support such claims.
