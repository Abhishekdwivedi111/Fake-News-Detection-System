Sign up In the early hours of Saturday morning, Venezuelans were jolted from sleep by the sounds of bombs falling. Video after shocking video shared over WhatsApp and social media captured the pre-dawn scenes of chaos: US helicopters whirling overhead, missile strikes, explosions across the capital Caracas and in three other states. \ud83d\udd34 AHORA: Aviones militares sobrevuelan Caracas.

That news was confirmed by Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who also demanded Trump provide proof that Maduro and Flores are still alive. This is the first US invasion of another country in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, when the US kidnapped and detained Panamanian President Manuel Noriega under charges of drug trafficking. The Trump administration used the same excuse today to detain Maduro, despite lack of evidence linking Maduro to drug trafficking, despite the fact that Trump recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of his own drug trafficking conviction, and despite the fact that Trump broke international law and, according to lawmakers in his own party, violated the US Constitution to carry out Saturday\u2019s operation. As I explained, at length, in the latest episode of my podcast Under the Shadow, Trump\u2019s attacks on Venezuela mark our return to a terrifying, not-so-distant past when the United States felt emboldened and entitled to carry out unilateral military action against sovereign nations to achieve its goals: Trump\u2019s Monroe Doctrine 2.0. But with this strike, the United States has taken an unprecedented step: this is the first time the United States has used its own military to invade a South American country. The US military operation in Venezuela has ended for now, but the seismic political fallout is unfolding in real time. Residents of Caracas tell me they are exhausted and scared. Many did not sleep last night, and electricity is still out in some neighborhoods. Some Venezuelans who opposed Maduro celebrated the attack over social media. This morning, Venezuelan supporters of Maduro hit the streets to protest the US invasion and Maduro\u2019s kidnapping. Marches and protests are being planned in the United States and elsewhere. Venezuelans are taking to the streets against the US overnight invasion that saw bombs fall across the country and resulted in the kinapping of president @NicolasMaduro and his wife. #Venezuela. https://t.co/SZ5yKuOlHZ\u2014 Michael Fox (@mfox_us) January 3, 2026 Top Venezuelan officials have called for calm and unity. \u201cLet\u2019s not fall into their provocation,\u201d said Venezuelan Minister of Interior Diosdado Cabello, flanked by members of the Venezuelan armed forces, in a video shared over social media. \u201cLet us not fall into despair. Let us have all the answers, and at the end of this battle, the people of Venezuela will emerge victorious. At the end of these attacks, we will prevail. Long live the homeland! Long live the homeland forever!\u201d In an address to the nation, Venezuelan Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez denounced the \u201ccriminal military aggression,\u201d and said that the country\u2019s armed forces would be mobilizing across the country. Numerous Latin American leaders have denounced the attack, including Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who wrote that Colombia \u201crejects the aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and of Latin America.\u201d \u201cThe bombings on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,\u201d Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva stated in a post online. \u201cThese acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.\u201d Brazilian president @LulaOficial responds to the US invasion of #Venezuela: \"The bombings on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line. These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous\u2026 https://t.co/TAs5wKNNjS\u2014 Michael Fox (@mfox_us) January 3, 2026 Lula has called an emergency meeting in his government over the US attack on Venezuela. \u201cThe action recalls the worst moments of interference in the politics of Latin America and the Caribbean and threatens the preservation of the region as a zone of peace,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe international community, through the United Nations, needs to respond vigorously to this episode. Brazil condemns these actions and remains available to promote dialogue and cooperation.\u201d The United States has kidnapped Maduro and his wife, invaded and bombed Venezuela, and President Trump claimed Saturday that the US would \u201crun the country\u201d and would be \u201cvery strongly involved\u201d in the operation of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. It\u2019s hard to guess what will happen next. But one thing is clear: The fallout across Latin America will be severe. The United States has once again shown that it has no respect for international borders or the sovereignty of foreign nations, but will act unilaterally and militarily to achieve its own ends by any means necessary. In this case, it\u2019s clear that those ends were not about drug trafficking\u2014if that were Trump\u2019s concern, he wouldn\u2019t have pardoned and released from US prison former Honduran president and convicted drug trafficker Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cThe objective of this attack is none other than to seize Venezuela\u2019s strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, in an attempt to forcibly break the Nation\u2019s political independence,\u201d the government of Venezuela said in an official statement released shortly after 3 a.m. Caracas time. The goal is oil, as Trump himself has stated again and again. This is the international extension of Trump\u2019s America First policy. \u201cWe want to surround ourselves with good neighbors,\u201d Trump said at Saturday\u2019s press conference, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna take back the oil.\u201d \u201cWe have to be surrounded by safe, secure countries\u2026 and we also have to have energy.\u201d \u201cI would say that if you\u2019re focused on America and America First, you start with your own hemisphere, where we live,\u201d US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity in early December. At Saturday\u2019s press conference, Rubio also suggested that other Latin American countries\u2014namely, Cuba\u2014may soon experience the same imperialist fate as Venezuela. And, as numerous analysts told me recently, the US is prepared to use its military to force its agenda in the region. \u201cThe National Security Strategy that the Trump Administration just published is essentially saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to use our military to get more out of Latin America,\u2019\u201d said Alan McPherson, professor of Latin American history at Temple University. But McPherson says this is more than a continuation of US intervention: \u201cYou know, in a sort of raw, realist way, it makes sense, because the military is the thing that the United States does the best in the world. Its economy is actually not what it does the best. It\u2019s the military. So it makes sense to use the military as leverage to get more raw resources, more markets. But at the same time, what\u2019s also happening is not a return to the past. It\u2019s an intensification of neoliberalism. Because what really comes out of the national security strategy, at least in terms of Latin America, is that the priority of the US government is US corporations. What essentially this government is saying is that governments are neoliberal puppets of corporations. And so we need to then apply this to foreign policy.\u201d We saw this policy rolled out last night in Venezuela. But Venezuelans on the streets this morning say they will not simply roll over and accept US domination. \u201cToday, we are calling on international institutions to denounce what has happened,\u201d said one Venezuelan woman who turned out to protest last night\u2019s US invasion. \u201cBecause the United States is not the police of the world and we Venezuelans are going to prove it. This is not about just a president. This is about a dignified people who are standing up,\u201d she continued. \u201cLong live a free Venezuela!\u201d Related Republish This StoryRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.
