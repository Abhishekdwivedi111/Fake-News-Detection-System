But critics say the event was designed to be incendiary and to poison relations at a volatile time.\n\nWhen Pamela Geller and her controversial organization, the American Freedom Defense Initiative, announced it would hold a cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, their plan to satirize and lampoon the founder of Islam was intended to have both a defiant and provocative free-speech edge.\n\nSunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contest and its $10,000 prize were prompted in part by the Paris\u00c2\u00a0Charlie Hebdo massacre in January, Ms. Geller said in March, as well as the riots in Muslim countries sparked by the publication of satirical anti-Muhammad cartoons by a Danish newspaper in 2005. And indeed, as if on cue, two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion, before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday night.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when tensions between some segments of American society and Muslims appear to be becoming more fraught \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with protests against Muslims in Texas and anti-Muslim social-media attacks after the release of the film \"\"American Sniper.\"\" In that context, Geller's actions raise questions about speech seen by many as motivated to incite anger and hatred.\n\nIt is an issue Geller has faced before.\u00c2\u00a0Two weeks ago, she won a federal free-speech case against New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which had refused to put up one of her ads: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a quote\u00c2\u00a0the ad attributes to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hamas MTV.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nGeller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organization has often clashed with officials in other cities, including Philadelphia and Washington, over their incendiary ads, some of which compare Islam to Nazism. In 2012, another federal judge ruled that cities could not refuse to post her subway poster that read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nMany supporters of Geller and her organization view the violence on Sunday as a vindication of their views of Islam as an inherently violence-prone religion. But for others, her relentless campaign to push the boundaries of free speech with intentionally incendiary messages is only poisoning public discourse at a particularly volatile time.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And coming as it did right when we, the United States of America, are really facing a time when we have to question what it is that holds us together, I can see this potentially aggravating the already-challenging times for dealing with some of these questions about cultural difference, diversity, and what kind of society we want to be,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Gordon Coonfield, director of graduate studies in communication at Villanova University near Philadelphia.\n\nAfter analyzing some of the submissions to the American Freedom Defense Initiative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Professor Coonfield pointed out the similarities of some of the depictions of the prophet Muhammad to posters for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Der Ewige Jude,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eternal Jew,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a notorious Nazi propaganda \u00e2\u20ac\u0153documentary.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn one of the cartoons, the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hook-nosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife. The caption reads, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When it comes to religion ... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got the edge.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The face, Coonfield notes, is nearly identical to the contorted face of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eternal Jew\u00e2\u20ac\u009d poster.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That strategy for creating a sense of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by lifting up this internal enemy is as old as human civilization and culture,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ironic that the kind of thinking that Hitler used, and the Nazis have become famous for using \u00e2\u20ac\u201c propaganda to try to create this sense of a collective by creating a strong unquestionably evil Other who is right here in our midst ... so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of ironic that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to link some of these things together, when that is in fact her message.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nDespite the fact that images depicting the prophet Muhammad cut deeply to the heart of Muslim identity, Muslim leaders in Texas told their followers not to picket or protest the event on Sunday.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Her words are not just free speech,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are inciteful; they incite hate against our whole community. I was very dismayed by the shooting in Garland, Texas, but at the same time, Pamela Geller is not the victim in this situation that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in right now.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153She intentionally put that event together in hopes that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get the response that she received,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Ms. Sarsour says.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We prayed, but not one Muslim from the state of Texas went out to protest her,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Muslim leaders specifically told people, do not go anywhere near her. Let her do whatever she does. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. And there was no protesting outside \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unfortunately, except for these two guys from Arizona, who were already on the radar of the FBI anyway.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvocates have tried to counter Geller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free political expressions with ad campaigns of a different tone. In 2012, a coalition called Rabbis for Human Rights responded to her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support the civilized man\u00e2\u20ac\u009d poster with an opposing message that read, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the choice between love and hate, choose love. Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAnd last week, the makers of the satirical film \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Muslims Are Coming!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d launched a humorous series of subway and bus ads to counter Geller's. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Muslims are coming, and they shall strike with hugs so fierce, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll end up calling your grandmother and telling her that you love her.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBut in an era in which the Islamic State, the Tsarnaev trial, and the lingering aftermath of 9/11 still inflame fears about Islam, many worry that Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violence will exacerbate the current tensions.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free speech is about being open to listening to the ideas you hate the most, that you disagree with the most, and I feel this group in particular is hiding behind this free speech rhetoric,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Coonfield says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t become the poster child for Christianity versus Islam or the West versus the Middle East. We have to maintain a space where groups that have very different ways of thinking and viewing the world can still come together to talk about it, without resorting to this kind of craziness.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\"\n",
